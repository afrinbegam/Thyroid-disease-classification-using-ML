Introduction:

               *The thyroid gland is a small organ thats located in the front of the neck,wrapped around 
  the windpipe.

*Its shaped like a butterfly,smaller in the middle with two wide wings that extend around the side 
  0f your throat.

*Define Problem / Problem Understanding:

                        Specify the business problem

                        Business requirements

                        Literature Survey

                        Social or Business Impact.


*Data Collection & Preparation:

                         Collecet the data

                         Data Preparation
